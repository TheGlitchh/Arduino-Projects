Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O
board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or
can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing and MaxMSP).
The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source
IDE can be downloaded for free at [https://arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

Arduino is an open source project, supported by many.

This repo contains all the codes I prepared while working on different projects!
